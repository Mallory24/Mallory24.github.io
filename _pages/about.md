I am a final year Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Jun.-Prof. Dr. Carina Silberer](https://sites.google.com/view/carinasilberer) (main) and [Prof. Andreas Bulling](https://perceptualui.org/people/bulling/) 
at the [Institute for Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) (IMS), University of Stuttgart.
My research interests lie in the intersection of language-and-vision and commonsense knowledge acquisition/reasoning.
My primary research goal is to extract commonsense knowledge from visual data to support knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.
